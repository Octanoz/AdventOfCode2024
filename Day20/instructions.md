# Day 20: Race Condition

The Historians are quite pixelated again. This time, a massive, black building looms over you - you're right outside the CPU!

While The Historians get to work, a nearby program sees that you're idle and challenges you to a race. Apparently, you've arrived just in time for the frequently-held race condition festival!

The race takes place on a particularly long and twisting code path; programs compete to see who can finish in the fewest picoseconds. The winner even gets their very own mutex!

## Rules

They hand you a map of the racetrack (your puzzle input). For example:

    ###############
    #...#...#.....#
    #.#.#.#.#.###.#
    #S#...#.#.#...#
    #######.#.#.###
    #######.#.#...#
    #######.#.###.#
    ###..E#...#...#
    ###.#######.###
    #...###...#...#
    #.#####.#.###.#
    #.#...#.#.#...#
    #.#.#.#.#.#.###
    #...#...#...###
    ###############

The map consists of track (.) - including the start (S) and end (E) positions (both of which also count as track) - and walls (#).

When a program runs through the racetrack, it starts at the start position. Then, it is allowed to move up, down, left, or right; each such move takes 1 picosecond. The goal is to reach the end position as quickly as possible. In this example racetrack, the fastest time is 84 picoseconds.

Because there is only a single path from the start to the end and the programs all go the same speed, the races used to be pretty boring. To make things more interesting, they introduced a new rule to the races: programs are allowed to cheat.

The rules for cheating are very strict. Exactly once during a race, a program may disable collision for up to 2 picoseconds. This allows the program to pass through walls as if they were regular track. At the end of the cheat, the program must be back on normal track again; otherwise, it will receive a segmentation fault and get disqualified.

## Examples

So, a program could complete the course in 72 picoseconds (saving 12 picoseconds) by cheating for the two moves marked 1 and 2:

    ###############
    #...#...12....#
    #.#.#.#.#.###.#
    #S#...#.#.#...#
    #######.#.#.###
    #######.#.#...#
    #######.#.###.#
    ###..E#...#...#
    ###.#######.###
    #...###...#...#
    #.#####.#.###.#
    #.#...#.#.#...#
    #.#.#.#.#.#.###
    #...#...#...###
    ###############
    
Or, a program could complete the course in 64 picoseconds (saving 20 picoseconds) by cheating for the two moves marked 1 and 2:

    ###############
    #...#...#.....#
    #.#.#.#.#.###.#
    #S#...#.#.#...#
    #######.#.#.###
    #######.#.#...#
    #######.#.###.#
    ###..E#...12..#
    ###.#######.###
    #...###...#...#
    #.#####.#.###.#
    #.#...#.#.#...#
    #.#.#.#.#.#.###
    #...#...#...###
    ###############

This cheat saves 38 picoseconds:

    ###############
    #...#...#.....#
    #.#.#.#.#.###.#
    #S#...#.#.#...#
    #######.#.#.###
    #######.#.#...#
    #######.#.###.#
    ###..E#...#...#
    ###.####1##.###
    #...###.2.#...#
    #.#####.#.###.#
    #.#...#.#.#...#
    #.#.#.#.#.#.###
    #...#...#...###
    ###############

This cheat saves 64 picoseconds and takes the program directly to the end:

    ###############
    #...#...#.....#
    #.#.#.#.#.###.#
    #S#...#.#.#...#
    #######.#.#.###
    #######.#.#...#
    #######.#.###.#
    ###..21...#...#
    ###.#######.###
    #...###...#...#
    #.#####.#.###.#
    #.#...#.#.#...#
    #.#.#.#.#.#.###
    #...#...#...###
    ###############

Each cheat has a distinct start position (the position where the cheat is activated, just before the first move that is allowed to go through walls) and end position; cheats are uniquely identified by their start position and end position.

In this example, the total number of cheats (grouped by the amount of time they save) are as follows:

| Cheats | Time Saved |
|--------|------------|
| 14 | 2 picoseconds |
| 14 | 4 picoseconds |
| 2 | 6 picoseconds |
| 4 | 8 picoseconds |
| 2 | 10 picoseconds |
| 3 | 12 picoseconds |
| 1 | 20 picoseconds |
| 1 | 36 picoseconds |
| 1 | 38 picoseconds |
| 1 | 40 picoseconds |
| 1 | 64 picoseconds |

## challenge 1

You aren't sure what the conditions of the racetrack will be like, so to give yourself as many options as possible, you'll need a list of the best cheats. How many cheats would save you at least 100 picoseconds?
